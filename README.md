# Smart Trip iOS

Itinerary builder companion application to the [service component](https://github.com/kelvinharron/smart-trip-service), created for my Masters Individual Project.

Current build is Swift 4 ready. Logic and views stirpped out for now as the plan is to build it into a usable application instead of a demo.


### Dependencies that were in use

- <s>Alamofire</s> Using URLRequest now 
- <s>SwiftyJSON</s> Using default Swift implementaiton now. 
- <s>Realm</s> No need to persist data locally at present.

### TODO 

1. <s>Migrate to Swift 4</s>. 
2. Rewrite with an architecture that decouples view and logic. IN PROGRESS
3. Implement dynamic views that aren't hardcoded to one screen size :).
